This folder contains programs I have written (or am writing) as a way of learning COBOL.

I am using the "Assembler" project from the Nand2Tetris course (Chapter 6) as the first major project.

This project is being completed on a MacBook Pro with OS X Catalina using GnuCOBOL

Future projects include ASCII Art in COBOL
