This folder contains programs I have written (or am writing) as a way of learning COBOL (for fun and for self-infliction of agony).

I am using the "Assembler" project from the Nand2Tetris course (Chapter 6) as the first major project. I recommend that course to any person who wants to better understand what is happening under the hood of their computer. Just look up nand2tetris.org and you will be sucked in, and to your own benefit.

This project is being completed on a MacBook Pro with OS X Catalina using GnuCOBOL

Future projects include ASCII Art in COBOL.
